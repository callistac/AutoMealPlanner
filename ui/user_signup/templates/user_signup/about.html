        <h2>What is this tool I have stumbled upon??</h2>
        <br>
        <p>
          Humans are inherently lazy creatures. Meal prepping for the week can require a lot
          of work, more than you'd probably want to put in considering your hectic,
          crazy life at UChicago--it's just one more thing you have to worry about
          on top of your SOSC essay and math pset and RSO meeting and research work.
          <br><br>
          And that's why we created the Automatic Meal Planner, a tool that generates random recipes for you
          based on your preferences, such as any dietary restrictions or budget limitations.
          If you dislikes a given recipe, you can deselect it from your weekly view
          and tell us why so we will only show that meal again if appropriate based on your
          response. You can also view your past recipes and rate them so we can get a sense
          of what you like, and also automatically create a grocery list for your weekly recipes.
          <br><br>
          All you have to do is sign up and tell us a little about your preferences, and
          your meals will be ready with the click of a button!

        <h2>Meet the Team!</h2>
        <br>
        <p>We are a group of astrophysics majors who decided to take CS 122 at UChicago because we are masochists.
          Life of the mind, ya know.
          <br><br>
        Really though, we enjoy problem solving and expanding our skills so we can be ~employable~
          <br><br>
        Ok, in reality, Callista is at fault here for cunningly convincing us to take this class.
        <br><br>
        But here's the final product! From regular expression to SQL, django to Jaro-Winkler distances, we used it all!
