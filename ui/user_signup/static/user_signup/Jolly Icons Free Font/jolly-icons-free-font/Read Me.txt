Full version of Jolly Icons Font (400 icons), including .svg files for custom font rendering, is avaliable at http://handdrawngoods.com

Open *demo.html* to see a list of all the glyphs in Jolly Font Free along with its codes/ligatures.

If you prefer to render your own version of Busy Icons Font using font rendering app (such as icomoon.io or fontello.com) containing only certain icons, use the files in the SVG folder.

You won't need any of the files located under the *demo-files* directory when including the generated font in your own projects.
